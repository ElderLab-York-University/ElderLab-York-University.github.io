This is the projects page for the [Elder Laboratory of Human and Computer Vision](https://www.elderlab.yorku.ca/). Our goals are to develop better theories of visual processing, as well as practical knowledge and algorithms that may be applied to problems in traffic analytics and visual surveillance. We collaborate with a number of companies and government organizations on this applied research.
